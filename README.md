# Text-Encryption-Decryption

## AES Encryption & Decryption
- Both encryption and decryption functionalities are contained within a single file, promoting simplicity.
- The project is divided into Encrypter and Decrypter classes, each handling a specific operation, aiding code readability.
- Both classes offer static methods, simplifying usage without needing object instantiation.
- AES encryption is utilized for robust encryption, ensuring secure data handling.
- User interaction is facilitated through a user-friendly console menu for selecting encryption or decryption operations, enhancing usability.
- Exception handling is implemented to manage potential errors gracefully, ensuring smooth execution.
- The code includes comments and descriptive method names, facilitating understanding and future modifications.


## Custom Encryption & Decryption
- The encryption and decryption functionalities are encapsulated within a single class named CustomEncryption, enhancing code organization and maintainability.
- User interaction is facilitated through a console menu, offering options to encrypt or decrypt a string.
- Exception handling is implemented to manage potential errors gracefully, ensuring smooth execution.
- Encryption is performed using a custom algorithm, where each character in the input string is shifted by a specified integer key.
- Decryption follows the reverse process, shifting each character back by the same integer key to retrieve the original string.
- The program prompts the user to input the encryption and decryption keys, providing flexibility and control over the encryption process.
- File input and output operations are utilized to store encrypted and decrypted data, enhancing data persistence and accessibility.
